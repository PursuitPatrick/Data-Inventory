      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="muted">Effective date: September 12, 2025</p>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how MagmInventory ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our
        website and services (the "Services"). By using the Services, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
      </p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Account and authentication data (e.g., username, hashed credentials, JSON Web Tokens) required to access protected features.
        </li>
        <li>
          Inventory and order data synchronized from connected platforms you authorize (e.g., Shopify, eBay, Walmart, TikTok, Etsy), including product details, inventory levels, locations, and order/fulfillment records.
        </li>
        <li>
          Technical data (e.g., IP address, device/browser information, timestamps, and diagnostic logs) to operate, secure, and improve the Services.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To provide and operate the Services (inventory, orders, analytics, and related workflows).</li>
        <li>To authenticate users and protect accounts, including fraud prevention and security monitoring.</li>
        <li>To maintain data synchronization with platforms you connect and act on your instructions (e.g., stock adjustments).</li>
        <li>To improve performance, reliability, and user experience, and to comply with legal obligations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell personal information. We share data only as necessary to provide the Services, such as with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Service providers (e.g., hosting, databases, logging) under contractual confidentiality and security obligations.</li>
        <li>Platforms you connect (e.g., Shopify, eBay, Walmart, TikTok, Etsy) according to your configuration and instructions.</li>
        <li>Authorities when required by law, legal process, or to protect rights and safety.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain information for as long as necessary to provide the Services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. You may request deletion of certain data subject to legal and operational constraints.
      </p>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        We implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to the nature of the data we process. No system is 100% secure; we continuously improve our controls and practices.
      </p>

      <h2>Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
      <p>
        We use cookies and similar technologies for authentication, session management, and analytics. You can control cookies through your browser settings; some features may not function properly if you disable them.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Choices and Rights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Access, update, or delete certain data via account settings or by contacting us.</li>
        <li>Disconnect integrated platforms at any time; future sync will stop after disconnection.</li>
        <li>Opt out of non-essential communications. Transactional messages will still be sent.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Third‑Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        Our Services integrate with third‑party platforms. Your use of those platforms is subject to their terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for third‑party practices.
      </p>

      <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Our Services are not directed to children under 13 (or the applicable age in your jurisdiction), and we do not knowingly collect information from them.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated “Effective date” and will be effective when posted.
